A Java Project for one of my ECE classes to make a virtual piano that uses 2 octaves.

The hardest part of the project was finding audio files for piano notes. You would be surprised at how hard it is to find them. The funny thing is that the source where I finally found a full set of piano note audios ended up being from a WoW addon (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/virtual-piano). Hurray for video game knowledge.
